AHLIOBS:

changelog:
- added compatibility to Probius patch:
	- top bar changes:
		- fixed top area showing all talents
		- fixed most heroic cooldowns not being shown
			- known problem: enemy team's heroics stop updating during player vision
		- fixed ctrl+W hotkey making Blizzard's new small top bar visible
		- fixed health/mana bars not being resized
		- fixed Tracer's heroic charge display
			- known problem: there is a chance that it appears in the wrong slot, but I assume this is limited to custom games with AI
	- bottom panel changes:
		- removed "VS" and role icons
		- fixed talent icons
		- fixed experience source labels of both teams showing no values
		- removed player vision's own hero indicator image
		- removed on fire animations that appeared behind stats
		- integrated colored background images into talent icons
		- moved quest progress label to the corner of the icon
	- moved healing fountain countdown slightly downwards to match position of the buff icons
	- unit details panel changes:
		- removed cooldown reduction % stat as it is unused
		- fixed life steal, siege damage and cooldown reduction description labels showing their text ID instead of a proper text
	- removed preselection indicator from Probius' structures
	- added low Health label into Probius' health bar
	- removed non-functional death recap button above the player vision's death timer
	- fixed KillLog panel not being visible
		- known problem: vertical position is not using the upmost slot until you switch to player vision for the first time
- added the talent icon to Talent tooltips, centered talent title
	- known problem: quest progress bar is currently hidden within the tooltip as the engine fails to properly copy its max value
- removed preselection indicator from Lt. Morales' Medivac
- removed colored ribbon from unit info panel as it is always red
- added Zul'jin's Guillotine damage into his hero UI. It is an approximation as it updates instantly while the real damage value updates only every 0.25s.
- unit details panel changes:
	- added physical, spell armor and kill streak that hide if 0
	- move speed hides if 100% or unit cannot move (e.g. structures)
	- spell power, life steal, cooldown reduction hide if 0%
	- fixed "stopped" and "stasis" buffs overlapping in the unit details panel
	- added HinderedHealing debuff (e.g. inflicted by Varian)
	- debuffs do not become instantly visible when the selected unit is switched (it still requires a game tick to reflect the unit's actual data)
	- updated images for resistant and vulnerable to match the ones next to the heroes' health bar
- fixed background image hiding in Ragnaros' hero UI
	- known problem: selection changes can cause the charge orbs to disappear and play a discharge animation

TODO:
- mvp UI ?
- muted the hidden Talent Selection and Character Sheet Panel ("Show" animation cannot be edited? -> removes entire frame)
- field for damage of some merc abilities, if possible...
- compare player names and try to show talent build for selected unit...
- TODO ragnaros hero UI is broken, molten power thingy, Guldan's has same problem

- remove ColumnTitleTemplate_L4workaround thing in leaderPanelBottom once it works
- remove TAB workaround once it works
- remove talent tooltip quest progress alpha=0 once propertybind copies maxvalue correctly

- CommandPanel's CurrentUnit stategroup


- ENGINE BUG: fixed clicking on buff icons in the unit info panel / talent in top bar / background of TAB window selecting another hero. Clicks now go through the icon.
