TODO:
- ext mod:
	- new production tab with chrono boost support?
		- put feature into observer interfaces
			- pro2020
				- the UI has an odd bug with missing highlight color when there is no extension mod used; maybe fix that?
			- GH3
			- GH4
	- joey's battle report?
	- new units lost panel with better order and suicide-banelings included?
	- is changeling appearance good? or can it be made better for observers?
	- ideas:
		- available scans counter (and maybe orbital counter)
	- revealing neutral units makes them brighter; originally they are not lit up
	- add player color in minimap pings like pickup, nuke and worm if possible
	- support HotS (+ give into to observer UI if possible)
	- support WoL (+ give into to observer UI if possible)
		- give map size to Observer UI? => dynamically sized minimap panels; background behind actual minimap
	- prevent player 15 from being active?

	other ideas:
	- sum of damage dealt by unit
	- 20% mined more, 10% traded worse
	- effective money: gathered - lost = effective money?
	- available scans (+ orbital count)
	- larva count?

- Pro2020 AhliMod
	- smaller leaderpanel tabs
	- minimap too small
	- unit groups should use rows of 8
	- bottom panel is very gray, should use more colors, e.g. for symbols of workers/army/minerals/gas
	- more transparency for dialogs
	- no abilities when multiple units are selected
- settings editor
	- recently opened files		initial implementation done; requires polish
- GH 4
	- integrate new graphs
	- appearance of map scores and player name
	- stylize graph panels
	- display chrono boost in leaderpanel
	- 2v2
	- other
	- possible to put a black image behind the actual minimap border?
	- check if 163 and 173 censorship in china can be prevented (e.g. supply value)
