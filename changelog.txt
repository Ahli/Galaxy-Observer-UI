changelog:
- added compatibility to 2.25.3 PTR:
	- added heroUI for D.Va and Tyrande (except for D.Va's defense matrix UI)
		- known problem: D.Va's life and energy bar are hidden while she is in her Mech (currently, there is no way to read data from her Mech as an observer, only her pilot mode is accessible)
	- added pink energy bars for D.Va
	- bottom panel's role stats now alternate, if healing and damage taken is both valid for a hero
		- known problem: some heroes display an empty role box
	- fixed Medivh's Portal's duration bar being grey instead of orange
	- fixed Tracer's hero UI
- unit details panel now shows physical armor vs Heroes, if different from generic armor amount
	- for example: Brightwing's E adds physical armor only vs hero attacks
- Medivh's Portal duration bar now adjusts its color in colorblind mode
- death timers in top bar were adjusted:
	- added an outline
	- now update properly in replays when you jump to other points of time
	- portrait darkens properly in replays
	- added skull animation on portrait on death
- fixed victims' portrait color when player vision is switched
	- known problem: if the hero was killed by a Mercenary Camp, the color can still appear wrong in player vision
- doubled animation speed of bottom panel tabs

TODO:
- mvp UI ?
- muted the hidden Talent Selection and Character Sheet Panel ("Show" animation cannot be edited? -> removes entire frame)
