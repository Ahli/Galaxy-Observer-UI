Some players are asking for settings for worse graphics in Heroes of the Storm for better performance.

The game stores settings in files named "Variables.txt" stored within the documents folder of the game. In Windows, it would be:
<font face="courier new, monospace">C:\\Users\\Ahli\\Documents\\Heroes of the Storm\\Variables.txt</font>

Here are the two worst that one can create:

<iframe title="YouTube video player" class="youtube-player" type="text/html"

    frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="270" loading="lazy">

<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/7bvamjz9sf2yze7/VariablesAhliPotato90sBlackTerrain.txt?dl=1">Download Settings for black terrain and worst sound quality</a>.<br>
You will see everything on the ground as usual. Just the ground is black.<br>
<br>
But it might be more difficult or near impossible to see stealth heroes like Nova, Zeratul and Valeera.<br>
<br>

Spotting cloaked heroes might be more difficult that on usual low settings (image below shows how the usual low settings look like).
<br>
<br>

<br>
These are the usual low graphic settings as creatable by the options in the game.<br>
No tricks were applied here. These are settings I would recommend to try, if you want more performance. You can see in the screenshots that the performance difference is low. However, reducing the sound quality might grant you a few more FPS in team fights (settings to tweak can be found below).
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Install / Uninstall</h2>
Rename the file to Variables.txt and use it instead of your usual one. It is recommended that you rename your existing Variables.txt as backup. The game will use the file that has the exact file name, so you can just rename it to "Variables backup.txt".<br>
<br>
To uninstall, simply remove the "Variables.txt" file. The game will create a new one with your default settings when launched.<br>
<br>
Please note that you should not edit the files while the game is running as the game overrides the files when it is closing. So, only edit the file while the game is closed.<br>
